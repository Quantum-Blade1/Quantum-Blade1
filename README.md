## What I Build/Intrusts

**Not apps. System Design and Infrastructure.**

I Build compilers for quantum computers that don't exist yet. I Research on optimizing trading algorithms using quantum mechanics. I Expresment mergeing neural networks with symbolic reasoning.

**Current focus**: HPC | Ccomputation-Compilation | Quantum-Enhanced ML | Research Publications

## Featured Projects(Based on Research)

### **DQC1** — Distributed Quantum Compiler
Custom MLIR/LLVM infrastructure for multi-QPU quantum systems.

- Built complete compiler with 4+ optimization passes
- Circuit partitioning, TeleGate synthesis, MPI lowering
- Production CLI tool (`dqc-opt`)

**C++ · LLVM/MLIR · MPI** → [View Code](https://github.com/Quantum-Blade1/dqc1)

---

### **Trading Engine** — Hybrid Optimization System
Research-grade execution engine using QUBO + QAOA.

- 38-67% improvement over traditional VWAP/TWAP strategies
- <10ms fast-path execution latency
- Real-time quantum solver integration
