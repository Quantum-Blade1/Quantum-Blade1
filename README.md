## Featured Work

### **DQC1 - Distributed Quantum Circuit Compiler**
Custom MLIR/LLVM-based compiler for multi-QPU quantum systems. Implements circuit partitioning, TeleGate synthesis, and MPI lowering with a production-grade CLI.

**Stack**: C++, LLVM/MLIR, CMake  
🔗 [Repository](https://github.com/Quantum-Blade1/dqc1)

### **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Trading Engine**
Research-grade execution system using QUBO optimization and QAOA. Achieves 38-67% improvement over traditional strategies with <10ms latency.

**Stack**: Python, Qiskit, Asyncio  
🔗 [Repository](https://github.com/Quantum-Blade1/Hybrid-Quantum-Classical-Optimal-Execution-Engine-for-Low-Latency-Trading)

### **Engineering Cogitative Core** (In Progress)
Neuro-symbolic AI framework enhanced with quantum primitives. Target: Conference publication 2025.
